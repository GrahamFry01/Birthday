Hi

Thank you for the opportunity to show you, my work.

Once you have set up your python environment you can run the bat file 0 will give you the necessary instructions


I took 5 hours to complete everything.

.5 hour to setup the environment
.5 hour to get back into python and flask.
2 hours to build the app at the end of two hours I had the app running but the insert of the new record was giving me an error I still had to comment the code and clean up the unnecessary line of code.
1 hour to trouble shoot and clean up.
1 hour to test and write the batch file.

From your spec you want somebody that will do enough to get it working but deliver a good product in good time.
I would have delivered this in about three and half hours without the batch file and only necessary code clean up.

If you have any questions, please let me know.

Graham
